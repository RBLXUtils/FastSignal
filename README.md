# [*Fast*Signal](https://github.com/RBLXUtils/FastSignal)

*Fast*Signal is a Signal library made with consistency and expectable behavior in mind, it is efficient, easy to use, and widely compatible.

## What about GoodSignal?

GoodSignal while being an interesting implementation (that even helped *Fast*Signal be developed), it suffers from some issues.

* GoodSignal does not support .Connected.

* GoodSignal is made only for Immediate mode, and does not have a Deferred mode option, while sleitnick's fork has `:FireDeferred`, it's not a very optimal solution as it's not a toggle, you have to go out of your way to use Deferred and it's inconvenient.

* GoodSignal has no :Destroy, only :DisconnectAll which means you can’t stop new connections from being created.

* GoodSignal’s :DisconnectAll does not call :Disconnect on connections, this causes an [inconsistency with RBXScriptSignals.](https://github.com/stravant/goodsignal/issues/4)

* GoodSignal’s connections and linked list nodes are the same reference, which causes issues such as disconnected connections can leak the connection’s function, signal, and other connections if not cleared properly.

* GoodSignal’s classes are strict, meaning you can index members that don’t exist, this is pretty useless, and means that empty fields in a class are false, and not nil, which is something that makes forking a bit harder and it takes a bit of time to process.

* GoodSignal’s connections are not immediately compatible with Janitor, or Maid.

* GoodSignal’s methods don’t have any type declaration at all, which would make it way nicer to use.

*Fast*Signal fixes all these issues.
*Fast*Signal's selling point is parity with RBXScriptSignal's API and *familiarity*.

*Fast*Signal has a familiar API and behavior to RBXScriptSignals and other signal libraries, which help you work faster, these help you not have headaches while using *Fast*Signal.
